# The Replacement Loop

The Replacement Loop is a single-page, LinkedIn-style parody app that cycles through a sequence of mock posts showing an AI-driven "replace everyone" storyline, eventually looping back to the starting role.

It is a static frontend project (no build step) built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What This App Includes

- A role timeline and auto-advancing carousel of posts
- LinkedIn-inspired post cards, reactions, and engagement stats
- Local media assets in `assets/` plus a sprite-based avatar sheet (`avatars-grid.png`)
